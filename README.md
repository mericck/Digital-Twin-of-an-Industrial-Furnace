# Digital-Twin-of-an-Industrial-Furnace
# ðŸ”¥ Digital Twin of an Industrial Furnace

A digital twin model of an industrial furnace built in MATLAB Simscape to simulate, monitor, and optimize the temperature profile of an object moving through the furnace. This project aims to support energy-efficient heating by enabling data-driven process optimization.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This repository contains a simulation model of a multi-zone industrial furnace. The primary goal is to track and control the temperature distribution of an object as it travels through different heating zones on a conveyor system.

The digital twin integrates:
- Physical modeling using Simscape (MATLAB/Simulink)
- Object temperature tracking
- Future integration with real-time sensor data
- Parametric analysis and basic optimization of process parameters
